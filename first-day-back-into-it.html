Clients are generally going through an upgrade to <strong>React</strong> cycle.</p><p>There are two courses I am aware of:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">Udemdy coursework</a></li><li><a href="https://epicreact.dev">Epic React course</a></li></ol><p>I’ve chosen to delay doing them just yet and carefully read through <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react">reacts.org</a>, from my Java days I tended to judge the utility of a framework based on the structure, principles, and rationale captured in the Javadocs. Have a good read first, then dive into working on examples. Spring framework and Jetty Servlet container where good examples of this back in ‘00 for me.</p><p>I know some people prefer to dive in, but I need to know why <strong>React</strong> since my Java days.</p><p>At the same time, I’m using ANKI to build a set of flash cards to represent and memorise the core concepts from React.</p><p>And thankful the documentation is good so far. You will need to go deep on the modern concepts of JavaScript, to keep up. So I’ll also build a set of ANKI cards on what I need to absorb with current JavaScript concepts.</p><p>My plan is set up an early morning routine of refreshing from flash cards and learning next steps. I’ll capture these efforts also.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://marcgalbraith.com/tags/coding/">Coding</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">© Marc Galbraith</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://marcgalbraith.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
