# Check point

It’s roughly been 9 months since I thought about writing again. This was mainly due a deliberate focus on coding and learning another language. I wrote in a previous [post]({% post_url 2022-08-03-first-day-back-first-lessons %}) that **React** was a popular theme at the time from colleagues I’d reached out too. And I am sure it still is. But since then I’ve joined [Global-Roam](https://home.global-roam.com), and at that company you’ll find .NET frameworks and libraries, C# as a key language, and TypeScript lining the source repositories.

I’ve experienced some negative feedback from other devs around the track, raising statements that some of those things aren’t cool, or not a pure fanciful functional paradise. From my perspective, I don’t care, so what. It’s the hand that has been dealt. I don’t mind, something like C# is a good OO language. And OO is still cutting it. C# feels like a cross between Java and C++.

I hear Kotlin is rocking along and all the cool kids are doing JavaScript, TypeScript, Go and eat Rust for breakfast, and oh, don’t forget the Python maple syrup. It doesn’t matter what your logic apparatus is, it’s rather the case of what’s appropriate for the job and fits the culture. If you can code with it, solve some real problems with it, get some sense of contribution from it, sounds like it is probably doing its job.

All languages we know of are human inventions. And a company is a collection of those humans emitting a culture. It’s the culture that accepts or rejects a coding language. Programming languages are very rarely chosen for their pure technical wonderment. Someone ultimately makes an arbitrary choice in a political melting pot and it begins. It really doesn’t matter what language it is, they all riff off each other. What matters is your own self-discipline, how you judge your capability and capacity to think, encode that thinking into lines of that software language and learn from it. Software is soft, so be flexible with it.
