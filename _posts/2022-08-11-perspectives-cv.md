# Perspectives CV

A little detour from researching the engineering world this week to focus on building my CV. A question. Do I create an engineering focused CV?

The problem with just that view is it doesn't explain what has happened between the gaps over the last 33 years of my working career. I am going to experiment with what I am calling a perspectives CV in my GitHub Repository.

It will be stylised different from my website to denote that its an experimental draft of sorts and then I'll work out how to incorporate it, or maybe its a simply a silly idea. Let's see!

I don't mind trying, my best thoughts at this moment is to split it into the following perspectives:
- Engineering
    - All things software
- Consulting
    - When I've been called upon for advice and change work
- Management / Leadership
    - Lead teams, running an area
