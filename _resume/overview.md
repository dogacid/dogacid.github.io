## About [Marc](https://marcgalbraith.com)

I’ve spent most of my career working at the intersection of software, organisations, and change.

I started as a developer. Over time I moved into architecture, technical leadership, consulting, management, and eventually back into hands-on engineering again. That movement wasn’t accidental — it reflects something consistent in how I think: I am interested in systems.

Technical systems.
Organisational systems.
How work flows.
Where complexity builds up.
Why performance degrades over time.

For the last few years I’ve been working as a Senior Software Engineer in the Australian energy market, building and maintaining data services using C#, SQL Server, Docker and Terraform on Microsoft Azure. It’s large-scale, regulated, data-heavy work. The kind of environment where reliability and clarity matter.

Earlier in my career I worked as a consultant and engineering leader across banking, telecommunications, retail and not-for-profit sectors. I partnered with executives on change programs, opened and ran a ThoughtWorks office, managed professional services teams, and helped organisations rethink how they deliver value.

Across those experiences, a few beliefs have stayed constant:

Strong engineering cultures are built deliberately.

Technical quality and organisational health are deeply connected.

You cannot improve what you cannot see — measurement matters.

Most persistent problems are systemic, not personal.

I’m particularly interested in Engineering Manager and Principal-level roles where I can combine technical depth with leadership. I value being close enough to the code to understand the trade-offs, while also thinking about team design, delivery systems, and long-term sustainability.

I don’t see engineering management as stepping away from engineering. I see it as shaping the conditions in which good engineering becomes possible.
