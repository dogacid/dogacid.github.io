## Engineering Leadership

**Manager - Professional Services** * [LEXICON](https://www.lexicon.com.au) (2021 - 2022)


Led the Professional Services operations function supporting 100+ consultants delivering software across multiple client environments.

  - Designed and evolved organisational structures, role definitions and internal operating systems.
  - Scaled the organisation from 78 to 137 people during a period of sustained growth.
  - Established clearer performance expectations and feedback mechanisms.
  - Coached consultants and emerging leaders on delivery, professional development and client engagement.
  - Oversaw hiring, workforce planning and difficult performance conversations where required.
  - Balanced commercial delivery pressure with long-term organisational health.

This role deepened my understanding of how engineering organisations scale — and where fragility appears if systems are not designed intentionally.
