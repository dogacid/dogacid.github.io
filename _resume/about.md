## About [Marc Galbraith](https://marcgalbraith.com)

I like helping organisations be positive and productive places to work. I'm also a self taught software engineer that happened to get a degree on the side. I learnt early in my career that its one thing to write code by yourself, its another world to produce good work in a team. So I did something about it and learnt how you organise, managing people, and be a productive team member.
