#### ENTERPRISE AGILE CONSULTANT (SUNCORP) - MELBOURNE (2017)

Leaders were struggling to improve delivery of their group. I gathered data over the last few years and helped leaders understand the link between these historical levels of production support and how it impacts their ability to take on work at these times, a view they did not have. Built a plan of continuous improvement and restructured their delivery pods.

CIO of Kmart wanted to understand the question, How do they deliver value faster? Taking a holistic view of the IT group as a system of delivery, interviews were done and data collected that revealed issues with their testing approach and conflicting priorities. Working with leaders, developed a plan of action which led to a major initiative to rebuild their merchandise platform.

I assisted their learning about performance from a customer’s point of view and a proof of concept team was able to reduce the time taken to do a customer withdrawal from an average of 28 days to 4. This drew poaitive attention and the establishment of multiple interventions across three cities to improve customer service.
