## Consulting & Transformation Experience

**Client Lead Consultant** @ [Reconceive](https://reconceive.com.au) (Sept 2019 - June 2021)

Worked with senior leaders and operational teams to improve the success of major change initiatives.

- Applied systems thinking, Systems Leadership principles, and the Vanguard Method to understand performance from a customer perspective.
- Analysed organisational data to uncover structural constraints and unintended consequences in delivery systems.
- Coached leadership teams in redesigning services around value flow rather than internal activity.
- Supported organisations through complex operational change while maintaining delivery continuity.

This period strengthened my focus on measurement, visibility and systemic causes of performance issues.
