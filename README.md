## About

I am an engineering leader and senior software engineer with over 20 years of experience across software development, organisational design and enterprise transformation.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer within the Australian energy market, building and maintaining distributed data services using C#, SQL Server, Docker and Terraform on Microsoft Azure.

Earlier in my career I led professional services teams, opened and ran a ThoughtWorks office, and partnered with executives across banking, telecommunications, retail and government sectors on large-scale delivery and organisational change initiatives.

Across these roles, a consistent theme has shaped my work: an interest in systems — technical systems and organisational systems — and how they perform under real-world constraints.

## Current Focus

- Engineering leadership
- Data-intensive cloud systems
- Organisational performance and delivery systems
- Sustainable, high-quality engineering cultures
